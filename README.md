Bowling Game Algorithm and Tests


The main function is held in bowling.js

To try your own results adjust the array found at index.js - ('node index.js' will allow you to run that)

The tests I have created are with MochaJS. ( 'mocha test' in the console will run it) 

**
As you'll see I tried to introduce an element of OOP programming to the task.
Words like Nil and X for strike I did originally allow to run as you can see in the commits,
but as I broke the file up for testing purposes I needed to change the values to bowling.x for example.


Normally for TDD we would write the test first but I was pushed for time with other projects and was eager to get 
the program fully functioning. This was actually great practice for my Mocha testing as I've done it only a
few times before this task. 

Thanks!

Hope you like it,
